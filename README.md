## About the Data set:
We are utilising the data set of publicly accessible Concrete Crack Images.
The data set from Ozgenel and Gonenc's paper was made available to the general public.
The data set consists of 20,000 images of cracked concrete structures and 20,000 images of uncracked concrete structures.
458 high-resolution images are used to create the dataset (4032x3024 pixel).
The data set includes one RGB image per 227 x 227 pixel image.
